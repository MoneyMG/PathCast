Description: PathCast is a golem app that is deployable from your command line. The app looks at 3 distintic diffusion processes and their characterisictics. After a visual
                      inspection of their characteristics, it then looks if there any preprocessing necassary before running through a machine learning process. Its goal is 
  to provide a comprehensive insight into the mental model behind ML design.
